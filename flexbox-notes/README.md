# Flexbox Notes

- default of `flex-direction` is horizontal (or 'row').
- we want `display: flex` to be on the parent, or container element.
- can use the `order` property to change the order in which elements appear.
- can use `justify-content: flex-start` (default) or `: center`, or `: space-around`, to change the way space flows in the direction of content, in the `flex-direction`.
- `align-items` moves in the perpendicular direction. Canse use `: baseline`.
- can apply `align-self` on a child, which defaults to `auto`.
